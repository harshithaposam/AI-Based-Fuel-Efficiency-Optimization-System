With the increasing number of vehicles on the road, the need for intelligent systems that reduce fuel usage and emissions is critical. This project aims to harness the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to develop a real-time, data-driven route optimization system that helps drivers choose the most fuel-efficient and eco-friendly routes.

The system is built around three core components: data collection, fuel consumption prediction, and route optimization. Real-time and historical data is collected using APIs such as Google Maps (for traffic and elevation), Open Weather (for climate conditions), and vehicle specification datasets. This data is cleaned, normalized, and structured to be used by machine learning models. A supervised learning model—Random Forest—was chosen to predict fuel consumption under various conditions, factoring in weather, road type, traffic congestion, and vehicle attributes.

For route optimization, the project uses the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. Roads are modeled as a graph, and simulated ants explore various paths, favoring those that offer lower fuel consumption and emissions. Over time, optimal paths are reinforced via pheromone trails, mimicking natural ant behavior. The system dynamically updates routes in response to changing real-time data such as sudden rain, increased congestion, or elevation changes, ensuring the selected route remains the most efficient.

To make this technology accessible, a web-based dashboard was developed using Flask/Django. This interface allows users to view the optimized route, compare fuel consumption across different paths, estimate CO₂ emissions, and receive real-time updates. An added feature is a credit-based incentive system that rewards users for choosing greener routes, encouraging environmentally responsible driving behavior.

The implementation involved several challenges, such as API rate limits, managing large-scale road networks, and ensuring real-time responsiveness. These were addressed through data caching, graph partitioning, and parallel processing. The prototype was rigorously tested across various terrains—urban, highway, and hilly routes—and showed promising results, achieving 15–30% fuel savings and up to 40% reduction in emissions compared to traditional navigation methods.

In conclusion, this project showcases the effective application of AI, machine learning, and optimization algorithms to solve real-world environmental issues. It not only met its objectives but also demonstrated the potential for large-scale adoption in personal and commercial transportation systems. The experience offered a comprehensive learning opportunity for the students, equipping them with valuable skills in data science, system integration, and sustainable innovation.
